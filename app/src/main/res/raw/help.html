        <H2>SshClient, version %versionname%</H2>
        <H3><A HREF="http://www.outerworldapps.com">Outer World Apps</A></H3>
        <P>A basic SSH Client that can be used to access remote computers that are accessible via SSH.
        Unlike some other Android SSH Clients, this one only requires internet access permission.</P>
        <P>
            There are 3 screens:
            <UL>
                <LI><B>MAIN</B> - contains the currently selected session's contents, consisting of a
                    connect-to single-line text box and a large screen text box.  This is the screen
                    you are usually on when communicating with a remote host.</LI>
                <LI><B>SETTINGS</B> - this has various settings that you can adjust as you like.</LI>
                <LI><B>HELP</B> - this screen.</LI>
            </UL>
            You can always go back to the main screen by clicking on the Android's menu button and
            then selecting main screen.
        </P>

        <H3>MAIN Screen</H3>
        <P>At the top is a single-line text box.  To initiate a connection to a host, type in the <TT>username@hostnname</TT>
        that you want to communicate with.  If it uses a non-standard port number (22), use <TT>username@hostname:portnumber</TT>
        format.  After entering the information, click the keyboard's Next or Done button to initiate the connection process.
        If the connection requires a passphrase or password, you will be prompted.  You may also be asked to confirm the
        fingerprint of the remote host to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.</P>
        <P>The app will remember what <TT>username@hostname[:portnumber]</TT>s you have successfully connected to, and
        provide them as auto-completion text next time you want to connect, so you don't have to retype the long strings
        on your small keyboard each time.</P>
        <P>The color of the text in the host name entry box is significant:
            <UL>
                <LI>BLACK - the app is waiting for the user to enter the information and click Done or Next</LI>
                <LI>BLUE - the app is attempting to connect to the remote host</LI>
                <LI>GREEN - the connection to the remote host is alive and authenticated and ready for use.
                            You can use the keyboard to send text to the host and the host's replies will
                            appear in the large text area below.</LI>
                <LI>RED - the host has disconnected or failed to connect.  To reconnect, click on the box and
                    either just click Done/Next to reconnect to same host or change the info first then click
                    Done/Next to connect to a different host.</LI>
            </UL>
        </P>
        <P>Note:  If you are having difficulty getting the soft keyboard to appear for sending text to the host,
           try clicking on the Android's menu button then selecting Main.</P>

        <H3>SETTINGS Screen</H3>
        <P>This screen holds customization settings.  Use the keyboard or click on the various settings to change them.
        The changes will not take effect until you click the SAVE button.  If you click REVERT, any changes you have
        made will be discarded and you can make new changes if you like.  If you click the Android's menu button then
        click Main, your changes will be discarded and you will return to the MAIN screen.</P>
        <P>Note:  The screen is locked in Portrait orientation while in the settings screen.</P>

        <H3>MENU Buttons</H3>
        <P>The Android's menu contains these main buttons:
            <UL>
                <LI><B>Ctrl-...</B> - the next character entered on the keyboard will be shifted to control character,
                    if it is an alphabetic.  If a non-alphabetic is entered, the Ctrl-... will be abandoned and the
                    character will be sent normally.</LI>
                <LI><B>Ctrl-C</B> - sends a Control-C character to the host.</LI>
                <LI><B>Freeze</B> - freezes the text in place on the screen (ie, blocks updates from the host), see below.
                    While frozen, the foreground/background colors are reversed.</LI>
                <LI><B>Paste</B> - sends the contents of a clipboard to the remote host.</LI>
                <LI><B>Tab</B> - sends a TAB character to the remote host.</LI>
            </UL>
        </P>
        <P>... and these extended buttons (accessed by clicking the More button in the main menu):</P>
            <UL>
                <LI><B>clear screen</B> - clears the MAIN screen text window.</LI>
                <LI><B>EXIT</B> - closes connection with remote host if any and closes the app immediately.</B></LI>
                <LI><B>HELP</B> - displays this help screen.</LI>
                <LI><B>known hosts</B> - brings up the Known Hosts menu (see below).</LI>
                <LI><B>local keypairs</B> - brings up the Local Keypair menu (see below).</LI>
                <LI><B>main screen</B> - displays the MAIN screen.</LI>
                <LI><B>master password</B> - displays menu for setting/changing master password (see below)</LI>
                <LI><B>saved logins</B> - brings up the Saved Logins menu (see below).</LI>
                <LI><B>sessions</B> - selects different sessions.</LI>
                <LI><B>settings</B> - brings up the SETTINGS screen (see above).</LI>
            </UL>
        </P>

        <H3>Known Hosts</H3>
        <P>Known Hosts are hostnames that you have acknowledged the fingerprint for.  If it is the first time you have
            connected to a particular host with this app on this device, you will be prompted to confirm the fingerprint.
            From that point on, the app will remember that you have confirmed the fingerprint and will not prompt you again.
            If you want the app to forget the remembered fingerprint, use this menu to delete it by clicking on it.</P>

        <H3>Local Keypairs</H3>
        <P>A Local Keypair is used to identify this app on this device to a remote host.  The identity can be used
        instead of a password so you don't have to store the password on your device and you don't have to type it in
        each time.  Also, some servers may be configured to require keypair authentication and will not accept any
        password at all.</P>
        <P>Once a keypair is generated (using random numbers), the public key must be appended to the server's
        <TT>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</TT> file.  If the server is configured to accept a password, you can log in using
        the password (do not save it) then copy/paste the public key into the server's <TT>authorized_keys</TT> file.
        If the server does not allow password logins, you will have to have some other mechanism to accomplish it,
        such as copy/paste the pubic key into an email that you send to the server's administrator.  If the
        authorized_keys file was properly updated, you will be authenticated using the keypair and will not need to
        enter a password next time you log in.</P>
        <P>When generating a keypair, it asks for the following information:
            <UL>
                <LI><B>Name to identify</B> - written as a tag on the public key so that at some time in the distant
                future, when you look at a remote host's <TT>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</TT> file, you will know where this
                particular public key came from, as it will be tagged with this identifier.  You can only use
                a-z, A-Z, 0-9, @, periods, underscores and hyphens in the name, and a maximum length of 50 characters.
                It is also used to differentiate multiple keypairs on the same device if you create more than one,
                as each one must have an unique name.  The identifier appears at the end of the single line of the
                public key.</LI>
                <LI><B>Passphrase</B> - used as a password for the keypair file itself.  This will safeguard the keypair
                file in case someone steals your device, they won't be able to access your authorized remote hosts.  The
                same passphrase goes with this keypair file, and since the same keypair file is used for many remote
                hosts, you only have to remember this one password.  Leave both boxes blank if you do not want a
                passphrase, in which case you should enable a master password (see below).</LI>
                <LI><B>DSA/RSA</B> - keypair encryption format.  There are many discussions on the Internet about which
                is more secure.</LI>
                <LI><B>1024/2048/4096</B> - key size.  1024 is the most universally accepted by servers.  The bigger
                the number, the more secure.</LI>
            </UL>
        </P>
        <P>You can also load a previously generated keypair that you have saved somewhere.
            It takes several steps to make this work:
            <OL>
                <LI>Copy the keypair into the device's clipboard using whatever method you have,
                    possibly from some other app.  The text must be formatted
                    to have the public key on the first line and the rest of the text containing the
                    private key.  Typically the public key line begins with something like <TT>ssh-rsa</TT> and ends
                    with the identifier it was created with.
                    The private key is several lines long and begins with a line like <TT>-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----</TT>
                    and ends with a line like <TT>-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----</TT>.</LI>
                <LI>Open the Local Keypair Menu then select load keypair directly.</LI>
                <LI>Click the Paste public & private keys from clipboard button.  You should see a few characters from
                the beginning of the public key and a few characters from the end of the private key string.</LI>
                <LI>Click the OK button.  You should get an acknowledgement message saying the keys were accepted.</LI>
            </OL>
            You can load the keypair from either the internal clipboard or the external clipboard.  For better security,
            use the internal clipboard wherever possible as it cannot be peeked at by other applications.
        </P>
        <P>Once created on a particular client, a keypair should not be deleted, as they represent an unique key that is
        used to unlock the hosts that you have added the public key to their <TT>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</TT> file.</P>
        <P><I><B>Caution:</B></I>  While it is perfectly acceptable to copy <I>public</I> keys using any method
        available, it is considered bad practice to copy <I>private</I> keys around, especially via the external
        clipboard.  The functionality is provided for completeness.  You might, at some level of risk, want to back up
        your private key (along with your public key) by pasting them to a secure host, using the <I>internal</I>
        clipboard.  <I><B>Use at your own risk!</B></I></P>

        <H3>Master Password</H3>
        <P>The app can store sensitive information on the device's internal flash memory, namely, the key pair files,
        the known hosts file and saved logins file which might contain saved passwords.  If the device were stolen, anyone could then access
        hosts authorized by those files, which is undesirable.</P>
        <P>To combat this, you should create a master password that must be entered whenever the app is started.  It is
        used to encrypt the files stored on the flash memory so they would be useless to anyone who does not know the
        master password.  You can set and/or change the master password at any time.  Changing it causes the files to
        be re-encrypted with the new master password.</P>
        <P>A master password is recommended if you have any saved passwords or a keypair without a passphrase.  It
        would be a good idea to at least have a simple PIN-style password (as opposed to none at all) if you do not
        want a hard-to-enter one.  The app places no restriction on what is acceptable.</P>

        <H3>Saved Logins</H3>
        <P>Saved Logins are the <TT>username@hostname[:portnumber]</TT> entries that have successfully connected and the
            corresponding saved password (if you checked the 'Save password' checkbox on the password entry dialog).  They
            also hold the name of the keypair tried if any.  They are displayed as auto-completion suggestions when you make
            an entry in the <TT>user@host[:port]</TT> box of the MAIN screen.</P>
        <P>If you no longer want one of the entries, use this menu to delete the one you don't want.  The menu displays
            the saved <TT>username@hostname[:portnumber]</TT> for each entry, and the name of the associated keypair if any,
            and a 'pw' tag if the password for the entry is saved.</P>
        <P>If you want to change or delete a keypair association or a saved password, the only way to do that is to delete the whole
            saved login entry for that login.  Then when you log back in, the entry will be re-created.</P>

        <H3>Sessions</H3>
        <P>The app can maintain more than one connection to either the same or different remote hosts.  Each connection is
        referred to as a session.  You can create, delete and switch sessions using this menu.</P>
        <P>To make a session current, short click on its button.  Its contents will be available on the app's main screen.</P>
        <P>To disconnect a session and delete it, long click on its button.</P>
        <P>Note:  When a session is not current, the app will continue to receive data from the host and update its hidden
        screen.  If you do not want it to update, you can freeze it first before switching away, then unfreeze it when you
        return back to it.</P>

        <H3>Freeze Mode</H3>
        <P>Freeze mode is entered by clicking the Android's menu button then clicking on Freeze.  While in freeze mode,
           data from the host is blocked so the screen won't update.  But you can still scroll around.  Also, the keyboard
           will not send characters to the host.  Rather, there are special characters that can be used to copy data to
           a clipboard:
            <UL>
                <LI><B>b</B> - begin text selection at the cursor</LI>
                <LI><B>c</B> - copy text selection to a clipboard</LI>
                <LI><B>i</B> - move cursor up one line</LI>
                <LI><B>j</B> - move cursor left one character</LI>
                <LI><B>k</B> - move cursor down one line</LI>
                <LI><B>l</B> - move cursor right one line</LI>
                <LI><B>r</B> - reset (discard) selection</LI>
            </UL>
        </P>
        <P>To exit freeze mode, click the Freeze button again.  The screen colors will go back to normal and any blocked
        host updates will be applied to the screen.</P>

        <H3>Clipboards</H3>
        <P>Several functions of the app access a clipboard.  In general, there are two clipboards these functions have
        access to.  The <B>internal clipboard</B>'s contents are only available to the app and can be used to transfer
        text information from one screen within the app to another.  No other app can access the internal clipboard.
        The <B>external clipboard</B>'s contents are available to any app on the device, so you can use it to, for
        example, transfer text between a connected host and an email message displayed in the web browser.</P>
