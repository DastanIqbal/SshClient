        <H3>Menu : clipboard &lt;-&gt; file</H3>
        <P>
            The <TT>clipboard &lt;-&gt; file</TT> button can be used to transfer text data between the internal or
            external clipboard and a local or remote file.  You must first be connected to a remote host for this
            button to work.
        </P>
        <P>
            Once connected, click this button.  A menu will appear with these 4 options:
            <UL>
                <LI><B>Internal clipboard -&gt; File</B></LI>
                <LI><B>External clipboard -&gt; File</B></LI>
                <LI><B>File -&gt; Internal clipboard</B></LI>
                <LI><B>File -&gt; External clipboard</B></LI>
            </UL>
        </P>
        <P>
            The first two options write one of the clipboards to a new file.  After clicking one of those buttons,
            navigate to the directory you want to create the new file in, then click the <TT>clip -&gt; file</TT>
            button at the top.  You will be prompted to enter the name of the file you want to create.  Be sure to
            enter a name that doesn't already exist in the directory, or you will receive a warning.  Click the
            <TT>OK</TT> button and the file will be created with the clipboard written to it.
        </P>
        <P>
            The last two options read an existing file into one of the clipboards.  After clicking one of those
            buttons, navigate to the directory the file is in and double-click on the file.  Then click the <TT>file
            -&gt; clip</TT> button at the top.  There must be exactly one file selected and that file must be readable
            for the <TT>file -&gt; clip</TT> button to appear.  The file is now in the clipboard.
