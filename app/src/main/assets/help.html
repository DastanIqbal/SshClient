        <H3><A HREF="http://www.outerworldapps.com">Outer World Apps</A></H3>
        <P>A basic SSH Client that can be used to access remote computers that are accessible via SSH.  Unlike some
            other Android SSH Clients, this one only requires internet access permission to make SSH connections and
            write external storage permission for the file transfer functions.</P>
        <P>
            There are five screens:
            <UL>
                <LI><B><A HREF="#SHELL">SHELL</A></B> - contains the currently selected session's contents, consisting
                    of a connect-to single-line text box and a large screen text box.  This is the screen you are
                    usually on when communicating with a remote host.</LI>
                <LI><B><A HREF="#FILETRANSFER">FILE TRANSFER</A></B> - lists the directory you are currently pointed
                    to, either on the remote host or on the local device.</LI>
                <LI><B><A HREF="#TUNNELS">TUNNELS</A></B> - lists the defined tunnels for the current session and
                    provides a method to define new ones, and open, close, delete existing ones.</LI>
                <LI><B><A HREF="#SETTINGS">SETTINGS</A></B> - this has various settings that you can adjust as you

        <A NAME="SHELL" />
        <H3>SHELL Screen</H3>
        <P>At the top is a single-line text box.  To initiate a connection to a host, type in the
            <TT>username@hostnname</TT> that you want to communicate with.  If it uses a non-standard port number (22),
            use <TT>username@hostname:portnumber</TT> format.  After entering the information, click the keyboard's
            Next or Done button to initiate the connection process.  If the connection requires a passphrase and/or
            password, you will be prompted.  You may also be asked to confirm the fingerprint of the remote host to
            prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.</P>
        <P>The app will remember what <TT>username@hostname[:portnumber]</TT>s you have successfully connected to, and
            provide them as auto-completion text next time you want to connect, so you don't have to retype the long
            strings on your small keyboard each time.</P>
        <P>The color of the text in the host name entry box is significant:
            <UL>
                <LI>BLACK - the app is waiting for the user to enter the information and click Done or Next</LI>
                <LI>BLUE - the app is attempting to connect to the remote host</LI>
                <LI>GREEN - the connection to the remote host is alive and authenticated and ready for use.
                            You can use the keyboard to send text to the host and the host's replies will
                            appear in the large text area below.</LI>
                <LI>RED - the host has disconnected or failed to connect.  To reconnect, click on the box and
                    either just click Done/Next to reconnect to same host or change the info first then click
                    Done/Next to connect to a different host.</LI>
            </UL>
        </P>
        <P>Once connected, by default, the app will open a shell channel and you can communicate with the host shell
            using the keyboard.  If you want to do file transfers or tunnels instead, you can switch to the file
            transfer or tunnels screen from the menu at this point and just leave the shell open.  Or if you prefer to
            have the app not open a shell at all, select file transfer or tunnels from the menu BEFORE connecting and
            the app will switch to that mode as soon as the connection completes without starting shell mode.  You can
            always go back to shell mode later by selecting <TT>shell</TT> from the menu.  Shell mode can also be
            terminated by typing an <TT>exit</TT> or similar command to the host so it will close its shell.  You can
            then switch to the file transfer or tunnels mode screen from the menu.</P>
        <P>Note:  If you are having difficulty getting the soft keyboard to appear for sending text to the host,
            try clicking on the Android's menu button then selecting <TT>shell</TT> (again if necessary).</P>

        <A NAME="FILETRANSFER" />
        <H3>FILE TRANSFER Screen</H3>
        <P>This screen is used to transfer files between the local device and the current session's remote host.  It
            has these four sections from top to bottom:
            <UL>
                <LI><B>function buttons</B> - switch between local and remote, initiates functions on selected file</LI>
                <LI><B>selected files</B> - list of files that have been selected</LI>
                <LI><B>navigation buttons</B> - select which directory on either local or remote to look at</LI>

            Notes:
            <UL>
                <LI>Each of the four sections independently scrolls horizontally.</LI>
                <LI>You can access a local-files-only version that does not require connection to a remote host by
                    clicking on the Android's menu button, then clicking <TT>More</TT> then <TT>local files
                    only</TT>.</LI>
            </UL>
        </P>

        <P>Various function buttons may appear on the top row depending on the state of the app.
           Here are the possibilities, in the order they appear:
            <UL>
                <LI><B>remote &lt;</B> - navigate directories on the remote host</LI>
                <LI><B>search</B> - search directories for a wildcard pattern</LI>
                <LI><B>make dir</B> - create a sub-directory (must currently be in a writable directory)</LI>
                <LI><B>clear</B> - clear list of selected files (must have something selected)</LI>
                <LI><B>copy</B> - copy selected files to the current directory (all selected files must be readable,
                    the current directory must be writable)</LI>
                <LI><B>move</B> - move selected files to the current directory (all selected files must be readable and
                    in writable directories, and the current directory must be writable)</LI>
                <LI><B>delete</B> - delete the selected files (files must be in the current directory and the current
                    directory must be writable, ie, you can delete files only from the current directory)</LI>
                <LI><B>open</B> - open the one-and-only selected readable file</LI>
                <LI><B>opendir</B> - open the last selected file as a directory (assuming it is a readable directory)
                    OR open the last selected zip file as a read-only directory (assuming it is a readable zip
                    file)</LI>
                <LI><B>&gt; local</B> - navigate directories on the local device</LI>
            </UL>
            <UL>
                <LI>The <TT>local files only</TT> version, accessed via the Android's menu, provides <B>local-1</B> and
                    <B>local-2</B> buttons which give two independent views of local files (instead of <B>remote</B>
                    and <B>local</B> buttons which give a view of remote files and a view of local files).</LI>
            </UL>
        </P>

        <P>The next row contains navigation buttons that can be used to 'pop up' levels in the directory hierarchy.
            If a button has black text, indicating a read-only directory, you can only view the directory, you cannot
            make changes.  If a button is red, indicating a read/write directory, you can both view the directory and
            make changes (add, delete, rename files).  Also, eg, on Android, it is possible for you to not have
            permission to view at an intermediate directory.  If this is the case, those intermediate directories will
            have their names combined with a viewable directory, eg, <TT>data/data/com.outerworldapps.sshclient/</TT>
            all on one button means you can't view either <TT>data</TT> directory, but you can view the
            <TT>com.outerworldapps.sshclient</TT> directory.</P>
        <P>Clicking on the last button in the row (which indicates the directory currently being displayed), refreshes
            the listing by re-reading it.  <I>Changes made in one view of a filesystem will not appear in other views
            of the same filesystem, so use this functionality to display any recent updates.</I></P>
        <P>To descend into a readable directory, click on it in the list (which causes it to highlight) then click the
            <TT>opendir</TT> button.  The <TT>opendir</TT> button can also navigate into a readable zip file as if it
            were a read-only directory.  Some patience may be required if the directory or zip file is large.</P>

        <P>To copy file(s) (and/or directory tree(s)):
            <OL>
                <LI>Select a file or directory tree to be copied by clicking on its name in the listing.  Its name
                    highlights in the directory listing and the name will also be added to the list of selected files
                    at the top of the screen.  If you have permission to read it, the <TT>copy</TT> button will
                    appear.</LI>
                <LI>To select a range of files, select the first file of the range by clicking on the name, then select
                    the last file of the range by double-clicking on the name.</LI>
                <LI>To deselect a file, click the highlighted name.  To deselect all files, click the <TT>clear</TT>
                    button at the top.</LI>
                <LI>Repeat that step for all files and/or directory trees you want to copy.  You can navigate around
                    directories to locate all you want.</LI>
                <LI>Navigate to the directory where you want to copy the file(s).  You may copy them to the same
                    directory you are already in if you like.  Usually though you want to navigate to a directory on
                    the other system (local vs remote).</LI>
                <LI>Click the <TT>copy</TT> button.  It will prompt you to confirm the copy, allowing you to change the
                    name if you like, then perform the copy.  You can cancel a long copy by clicking the
                    <TT>Cancel</TT> button when the progress box is showing.</LI>
            </OL>
        </P>
        <P>Notes:
            <UL>
                <LI>There is no restriction on local vs remote for the copy operation.  <I>However,</I> if you do a
                    remote-to-remote copy, the data will transfer from the remote host to the phone then back to the
                    remote host which is very inefficient.  You are much better off using the shell to perform such a
                    copy for files of any significant size.</LI>
                <LI>When a file is copied to the Android device, Android considers the file as being owned by the
                    SshClient app.  To make it accessible to other apps, you should put it somewhere on the SD card
                    storage, which is where the app puts you by default.  Similarly, you can only copy files from the
                    Android device that the SshClient app has access to, which is typically just its own files, the
                    files on the SD card storage, plus some read-only system files.</LI>
                <LI>While a copy is going (such as for a large file), the app will block you from accessing the same
                    session's shell and tunnels screens, because the TCP connection is being heavily used for the copy
                    and may not allow access to the other streams.  You can pause the copy and access the other streams
                    or start another session to the same host to access shell and tunnel while the copy is
                    running.</LI>
                <LI>Similarly, while a copy is going, you will be blocked from using the BACK button, in which case you
                    can pause or cancel the copy, then use the BACK button.</LI>
                <LI>Pressing the HOME button while a copy is running lets the copy continue in the background, even if
                    Android decides it needs the memory and kills the app, as the service will keep it going.</LI>
            </UL>
        </P>

        <P>To move file(s) (or directory tree(s)), perform the same steps as for copying, except use the <TT>move</TT>
            button instead of <TT>copy</TT>.  Note that moving a file to the same directory with a different name is a
            rename operation.  Moving a file between the local and remote system involves a copy operation followed by
            a delete.</P>

        <P>The <TT>open</TT> button will attempt to open the highlighted file if it is readable.  If it is a file on
            the local filesystem, a search is made for an application that can read the file and it is launched.  If
            the file is on the remote host, the file is first copied to a local temporary file directory (called cache
            on Android), then an application is launched.  You may want to either delete or move the file from the
            cache directory when done with it.  Note that the file must also be readable to the application being used
            to display it, which will be the case for files on the SD card.</P>

        <A NAME="TUNNELS" />
        <H3>TUNNELS Screen</H3>
        <P>SSH tunnels can forward TCP connections on either the local or remote host over to the other host.</P>
        <P>This screen has one button per tunnel defined in the database.  If the button has black text, the tunnel is
            closed and a short click will open or edit it.  If the button has red text, the tunnel is open and a short
            click will close it.  In either state, a long click will delete it from the database, closing it first if
            it is open.</P>
        <P>You must already be connected to a remote host for the TUNNELS screen to display.  If you attempt to display
            it before connecting, the opening will be pending until you connect, and then the TUNNELS screen will open.
            You can also switch to a different screen within the app or press the HOME button at any time and your open
            tunnels will remain open (until Android decides it needs the memory for something else, that is).</P>
        <P><B>Local =&gt; Remote</B> - connections to a port on the local Android device are forwarded to the port on
            the remote host, encrypted over the SSH connection.  If you put 0 for the listening port number, an unused
            port is picked for you each time the tunnel is opened.  Anyway, any connection made on the Android device
            to the tunnel's listen port are forwarded over the SSH link to the session's remote host, then it is
            connected to the tunnel's connection hostname:portnumber.</P>
        <P><B>Local &lt;= Remote</B> - connections to a port on the remote host are forwarded to the port on the local
            Android device, encrypted over the SSH connection.  You must specify a specific listening port (1..65535).
            Any connection made to the tunnel's listen port on the remote host are forwarded over the SSH link back to
            the Android device then it is connected to the tunnel's connection hostname:portnumber.</P>

        <H3>Known Hosts</H3>
        <P>Known Hosts are hostnames that you have acknowledged the fingerprint for.  If it is the first time you have
            connected to a particular host with this app on this device, you will be prompted to confirm the
            fingerprint.  From that point on, the app will remember that you have confirmed the fingerprint and will
            not prompt you again.  If you want the app to forget the remembered fingerprint, use this menu to delete
            it by clicking on it.</P>
        <P><A HREF="#TOP">(top)</A></P>

        <A NAME="LocalKeypairs" />
        <H3>Local Keypairs</H3>
        <P>A Local Keypair is used to identify this app on this device to a remote host.  The identity can be used
            instead of a password so you don't have to store the password on your device and you don't have to type it
            in each time.  Also, some servers may be configured to require keypair authentication and will not accept
            any password at all.</P>
        <P>Once a keypair is generated (using random numbers), the public key must be appended to the server's
            <TT>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</TT> file.  If the server is configured to accept a password, you can log in
            using the password (do not save it) then copy/paste the public key into the server's
            <TT>authorized_keys</TT> file.  If the server does not allow password logins, you will have to have some
            other mechanism to accomplish it, such as copy/paste the pubic key into an email that you send to the
            server's administrator.  If the <TT>authorized_keys</TT> file was properly updated, you will be
            authenticated using the keypair and will not need to enter a password next time you log in.</P>
        <P>When generating a keypair, it asks for the following information:
            <UL>
                <LI><B>Name to identify</B> - written as a tag on the public key so that at some time in the distant
                    future, when you look at a remote host's <TT>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</TT> file, you will know where
                    this particular public key came from, as it will be tagged with this identifier.  You can only use
                    a-z, A-Z, 0-9, @, periods, underscores and hyphens in the name, and a maximum length of 50
                    characters.  It is also used to differentiate multiple keypairs on the same device if you create
                    more than one, as each one must have an unique name.  The identifier appears at the end of the
                    single line of the public key.</LI>
                <LI><B>Passphrase</B> - used as a password for the keypair file itself.  This will safeguard the
                    keypair file in case someone steals your device, they won't be able to access your authorized
                    remote hosts.  The same passphrase goes with this keypair file, and since the same keypair file is
                    used for many remote hosts, you only have to remember this one passphrase.  Leave both boxes blank
                    if you do not want a passphrase, in which case you should enable a <A HREF="#MasterPassword">master
                    password</A>.</LI>
                <LI><B>DSA/RSA</B> - keypair encryption format.  There are many discussions on the Internet about which
                    is more secure.</LI>
                <LI><B>1024/2048/4096</B> - key size.  1024 is the most universally accepted by servers.  The bigger
                    the number, the more secure.</LI>
            </UL>
        </P>
        <P>You can also load a previously generated keypair that you have saved somewhere.  It takes several steps to
            make this work:
            <OL>
                <LI>Copy the keypair into the device's clipboard using whatever method you have, possibly from some
                    other app.  The text must be formatted to have the public key on the first line and the rest of the
                    text containing the private key, which is several lines long.  Typically the public key line begins
                    with something like <TT>ssh-rsa</TT> and ends with the identifier it was created with.  The private
                    key is several lines long and begins with a line like <TT>-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----</TT> and
                    ends with a line like <TT>-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----</TT>.</LI>
                <LI>Click the Android's menu button then click on <TT>local keypairs</TT> then select <TT>load keypair
                    directly</TT>.</LI>
                <LI>Click either the <TT>Load from internal clipboard</TT> or <TT>Load from external clipboard</TT>
                    button.  You should see a few characters from the beginning of the public key and a few characters
                    from the end of the private key string.</LI>
                <LI>Click the <TT>OK</TT> button.  You should get an acknowledgement message saying the keys were
                    accepted.</LI>
            </OL>
            You can load the keypair from either the internal clipboard or the external clipboard.  For better
            security, use the internal clipboard wherever possible as it cannot be peeked at by other applications.
        </P>
        <P>Once created on a particular client, a keypair should not be deleted, as they represent an unique key that
            is used to unlock the hosts that you have added the public key to their <TT>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</TT>
            file.</P>
        <P><I><B>Caution:</B></I>  While it is perfectly acceptable to copy <I>public</I> keys using any method
            available, it is considered bad practice to copy <I>private</I> keys around, especially via the external
            clipboard.  The functionality is provided for completeness.  You might, at some level of risk, want to
            back up your private key (along with your public key) by pasting them to a secure host, using the
            <I>internal</I> clipboard, or use file transfer mode.  <I><B>Use at your own risk!</B></I></P>
        <P><A HREF="#TOP">(top)</A></P>

        <A NAME="MasterPassword" />
        <H3>Master Password</H3>
        <P>The app stores sensitive information on the device's internal flash memory, namely, the key pair files, the
            known hosts file and saved logins file which might contain saved passwords.  If the device were stolen,
            anyone could then access hosts authorized by those files, which is undesirable.</P>
        <P>To combat this, you should create a master password that must be entered whenever the app is started.  It is
            used to encrypt the files stored on the flash memory so they would be useless to anyone who does not know
            the master password.  You can set and/or change the master password at any time.  Changing it causes the
            files to be re-encrypted with the new master password.</P>
        <P>A master password is especially recommended if you have any saved passwords or a keypair without a
            passphrase.  It would be a good idea to at least have a simple PIN-style password (as opposed to none at
            all) if you do not want a hard-to-enter one.  The app places no restriction on what is acceptable, except
            that it not be blank.</P>
        <P><A HREF="#TOP">(top)</A></P>

        <A NAME="SavedLogins" />
        <H3>Saved Logins</H3>
        <P>Saved Logins are the <TT>username@hostname[:portnumber]</TT> entries that have successfully connected and
            the corresponding saved password (if you checked the 'Save password' checkbox on the password entry
            dialog).  They also hold the name of the keypair tried, if any.  They are displayed as auto-completion
            suggestions when you make an entry in the <TT>user@host[:port]</TT> box of the SHELL screen.</P>
        <P>If you no longer want one of the entries, use this menu to delete the one you don't want.  The menu displays
            the saved <TT>username@hostname[:portnumber]</TT> for each entry, and the name of the associated keypair
            if any, and a 'pw' tag if the password for the entry is saved.</P>
        <P>If you want to change or delete a keypair association or a saved password, the only way to do that is to
            delete the whole saved login entry for that login.  Then when you log back in, the entry will be
            re-created.</P>

        <A NAME="Sessions" />
        <H3>Sessions</H3>
        <P>The app can maintain more than one connection to either the same or different remote hosts.  Each
            connection is referred to as a session.  You can create, delete and switch sessions using this menu.</P>
        <P>To make a session current, short click on its button.  Its contents will be available on the app's shell,
            file transfer and/or tunnel screens.</P>
        <P>To disconnect a session and delete it, long click on its button.</P>
        <P>Note:  When a session is not current, the app will continue to receive data from the host and update its
            hidden screen.  If you do not want it to update, you can <A HREF="#FreezeMode">freeze</A> it first before
            switching away, then unfreeze it when you return back to it.</P>
        <P>The Android's status bar will display the number of connected sessions.  The sessions will remain active
            even if you switch to another app, and the status bar line will remind you that there are active
            sessions.</P>
        <P><A HREF="#TOP">(top)</A></P>

        <A NAME="FreezeMode" />
        <H3>Freeze Mode</H3>
        <P>Freeze mode is entered by clicking the Android's menu button then clicking on Freeze.  While in freeze mode,
            data from the host is blocked so the screen won't update.  But you can still scroll around.  Also, the
            keyboard will not send characters to the host.  Rather, there are special characters that can be used to
            copy data to a clipboard:
            <UL>
                <LI><B>b</B> - begin text selection at the cursor</LI>
                <LI><B>c</B> - copy text selection to a clipboard</LI>
                <LI><B>i</B> - move cursor up one line</LI>
                <LI><B>j</B> - move cursor left one character</LI>
                <LI><B>k</B> - move cursor down one line</LI>
                <LI><B>l</B> - move cursor right one line</LI>
                <LI><B>r</B> - reset (discard) selection</LI>
            </UL>
        </P>
        <P>To exit freeze mode, click the Freeze button again.  The screen colors will go back to normal and the host
            will be released to update the screen.</P>

        <A NAME="Clipboards" />
        <H3>Clipboards</H3>
        <P>Several functions of the app access a clipboard.  In general, there are two clipboards these functions have
            access to.  The <B>internal clipboard</B>'s contents are only available to the app and can be used to
            transfer text information from one screen within the app to another.  No other app can access the internal
            clipboard.  The <B>external clipboard</B>'s contents are available to any app on the device, so you can use
            it to, for example, transfer text between a connected host and an email message displayed in the web
            browser.</P>
        <P>The app will only access text-oriented clipboard data.  It will not properly handle other data such as in
            image, video and sound files.</P>
        <P>The extended menu contains a <TT>clipboard &lt;-&gt; file</TT> button.  Clicking it brings up another menu
            with these buttons:

                <LI><B>File -&gt; Internal clipboard</B> - reads the one-and-only selected file to the internal
